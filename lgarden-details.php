    <strong>Convenient Height</strong><br>
    Ergonomically designed for healthy gardening, the <strong>LGarden's</strong> raised garden bed creates a waist-high gardening experience that will eliminate back and knee strain. With easy reach from all sides, the LGarden is also ideal for gardeners that require sitting while they work or have a limited range of motion. It's also just low enough for young gardeners, of course!

    <strong>Easy Mobility</strong><br>
    Four large, scratch resistant wheels allow the <strong>LGarden</strong> to safely transport up to 500 pounds. It travels on almost any decking or patio surface with ease, and because you can lock the wheels, your LGarden will not roll in high winds or on unlevel surfaces.

  <strong>Reinforced Carriage</strong><br>
    The <strong>LGarden</strong> is engineered to safely maneuver 500 lbs. of soil and plants, and the purpose-built wheels plus the reinforced carriage were designed so you can roll your mobile garden bed at any time. Whether you're making space for outdoor entertaining, moving plants to best access sun, rain or covered areas when needed, the LGarden makes the process safe and easy. You can even roll it indoors for fair weather planting or to get plantings out of the cold for a longer growing season.
