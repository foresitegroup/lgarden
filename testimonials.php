  <h2>Testimonials</h2>

  I retired several years ago and live in a community not far from the city. The outdoor space is a patio that I share with several other people, and it's only about 12 feet by 15 feet. I absolutely love my LGarden because it lets me have a garden despite my limited space. I can leave it out in the open to get the sun all day, but if we have a gathering on the patio I can roll it close to the wall.  It really changed how I spend my summer days.<br>

  After being confined to a wheelchair, my limited range of motion forced me to give up my longtime gardening hobby. Thankfully, the LGarden gave me my "green thumb" back! The great accessibility lets me to tend to my own garden again. It's a great feeling.<br>
