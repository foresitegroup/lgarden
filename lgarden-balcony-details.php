  <h2>LGarden Balcony Details</h2>

  <strong>Designed &amp; Manufactured in the USA</strong><br>
  Today people are spending a lot more time on their decks and patios as they seek refuge from the stresses of the day. It was that awareness that fostered our balcony design. The combination of the natural western red cedar with the permanence of the steel framework bestows a rich furniture feel enhancing this revered space. Technically engineered for structural integrity, the <strong>LGarden Balcony</strong> will function in style for years. <br>

    <strong>Convenient Height</strong><br>
    Ergonomically designed, the <strong>LGarden Balcony</strong> creates a waist-high gardening experience that eliminates the negatives commonly associated with traditional gardening. Having the vessel 32" off the ground eliminates the need to bend, prevents weed seeds from blowing in and keeps rabbits out. You're thinking, buy two units, aren't you?  Easily reached from all sides, the <strong>LGarden Balcony</strong> is also ideal for gardeners that require sitting while they work or have a limited range of motion.

    <strong>Easy Mobility</strong><br>
    Whether moving to access the sun, rain or just making room for a party, the <strong>LGarden Balcony</strong> transfers easy. Two scratch resistant wheels provide for smooth travel on almost any decking or balcony surface. The "balcony's" non-wheel legs are firm to the ground, so your LGarden remains stationary.

  <div class="tour-right">
  <strong>Western Red Cedar</strong><br>
    The <strong>LGarden Balcony</strong> incorporates long lasting western red cedar for the vessel's inserts to house the soil and plants. The red-brown timber has a tight, straight grain; western red cedar is valued for its distinct appearance and its high natural resistance to decay. But unlike other elevated gardens, should you find that a board needs replacing; simply call us or have one cut at any home center (no hardware is needed with the boards).
